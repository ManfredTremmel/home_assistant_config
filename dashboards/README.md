# Dashboards

My dashboard exported as yaml file (at the moment it's only one, may change in the future).

## Homepage

I divided the dashboard's homepage into three columns:

- photovoltaics on the left
- heat pump in the middle
- further information on the right, there I included the garbage collection times, the Fritzbox's internet connection, and information about my NAS.

## Subpages

The Dashboard Homepage links to subpages for additional details.

### Solar Generator (PV)

Clicking on “PV” on the Power Flow Card Plus redirects you to a subpage that shows details about solar power production.

### Battery (Batterie)

Behind “Battery” on the Power Flow Card Plus is the solar battery details page.

### Grid (Netz)

And finally, behind "Grid," I've included a page that allows you to limit grid feed-in. Furthermore, there's an analysis
for the PV Forum's regular yield meeting, based on the work of Thomas Harm.

### Heat Pump Settings

The heat pump card, in turn, links in the upper area to a subpage that allows various settings for the heat pump.

### Heat Pump Details

In the lower area, however, a subpage with further information about the heat pump is called up.
